					How to Use This Website (Please Read)
				</h2>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>
					The quizzes on this website are not meant to test your understading so much as they are meant to act as a digital look-cover-write-check system. Some answers may not be obvious on your first try, and some will be obvious even if you wouldn't be able to answer a question on the topic in an exam. These quizzes are simply meant to help you remember facts (worded in the way the specification would like you to remember them) by getting you to type out certain keywords and fill in blanks. That being said, they will test your understanding of certain GCSE topics, but not to the extent that a GCSE workbook would, so it is not recommended that you use this program in this way.
